Description: 
    An automated grading system for R programming assignments with a modern
    modular C++ backend. Features include parallel test execution, integrated
    performance benchmarking with optional bonus points, advanced error handling,
    custom feedback, AES-based encryption for test case protection, high-performance
    object comparison, comprehensive input validation, data file support (CSV, Excel,
    RDS, RData, TXT), and private repository authentication with GitHub tokens.
    Securely fetches test cases and data files from remote repositories and provides
    detailed feedback to help students learn.
