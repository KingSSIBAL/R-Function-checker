Description: 
    An automated grading system for R programming assignments with a modern
    modular C++ backend. Features include parallel test execution, advanced
    error handling, custom feedback, AES-based encryption for test case 
    protection, high-performance object comparison, comprehensive input
    validation, data file support (CSV, Excel, RDS, RData, TXT), and private
    repository authentication with GitHub tokens. Securely fetches test cases
    and data files from remote repositories and provides detailed feedback 
    to help students learn.
