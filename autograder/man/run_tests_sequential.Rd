\title{Run tests sequentially (one after another)}
\usage{
run_tests_sequential(
  student_fun,
  instructor_fun,
  test_data,
  tolerance,
  data_cache = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{student_fun}{Student's function}

\item{instructor_fun}{Instructor's reference function}

\item{test_data}{Validated test case data}

\item{tolerance}{Numeric tolerance}

\item{data_cache}{Named list of loaded data objects (optional)}
}
\value{
List of test results (same structure as parallel version)
}
\description{
Executes test cases one at a time in order. Used for:
\itemize{
\item Small test sets (<10 tests)
\item When use_parallel = FALSE
\item Debugging (easier to trace)
}

Advantages over Parallel:
\itemize{
\item No setup overhead
\item Easier debugging (linear execution)
\item More predictable
\item Better for small test sets
}
}
\details{
Execution Flow:
For each test:
1. Extract input arguments
2. Inject data if needed
3. Call student function (catch errors)
4. Call instructor function (catch errors)
5. Package results
6. Move to next test

Error Handling:
Errors are captured, not thrown. This allows:
\itemize{
\item All tests to run (one failure doesn't stop others)
\item Detailed error reporting for each test
\item Graceful handling of student code errors
}
}
