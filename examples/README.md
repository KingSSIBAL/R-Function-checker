# Examples

This directory can host small, focused examples demonstrating how to use the autograder in different scenarios.

Suggested examples:

- Basic function grading (e.g., `fibonacci` or `factorial`).
- Using external data files in test cases.
- Switching between legacy and secure modes.
- Creating and encrypting a new problem repository for a course.
